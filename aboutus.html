                <h2 class="">1971-1980</h2>
                <p class="">In 1971, our captain Robert Fishman had a vision of opening
                    a world-class seafood restaurant during a fever dream after drinking
                    too much seawater. The SS L'océan was opened to a crowd of the captain's uncle,
                    and quickly became to the go-to spot for delicious meals when there were
                    literally no other options around.

                <p class="">The SS L'océan began the "Catch Your Own Meal" program, becoming
                    our most popular attraction right after the "Help Us Find Our Way to Land We Miss Our Families"
                    program.

                <p class="">Unfortunately, all records of this time have been lost to the sea.
                    Did our head chef continue to expand on our menu of wonderful delicacies?
                    Did the restaurant staff successfully summon Xal'Teth, chaos lord of the sea?
                    Only the waves know the truth.

                        performance</i>

                <p class="">Nearing our 50th anniversary, the SS L'océan continues to be proud
                    to serve the people that are able to find us. With some considering us "the best
                    and only restaurant in the Atlantic Ocean", the SS L'océan continues to realize our
                    founder's vision of being a world-class seafood restaurant.
